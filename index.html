               The Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District believes that technology is s a tool to provide students with 21st Century skills, which will keep them competitive in the global workplace. It is not enough to simply add technology into existing teaching methods. Instead, technology must be strategically implemented to maximize the benefit to the students.  In short, the team believes our professional development needs to focus on how we are teaching instead of what we are teaching. We believe that technology should be part of our everyday norm. The benefits of a technology-infused classroom include the ability for teachers to deliver personalized learning to students, increase students' technology and 21st Century skills, and empower students in the learning process. Using technology during daily instruction will allow our classrooms to be:

Student-Centered

Student-Directed

Delivers Personalized, Differentiated Instruction

Encourages 21st Century Skills: Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication, and Creativity

Allows students to access, manage, and synthesize resources

Encourages students to be digital citizens who participate in a global society

                    Always focused on health and wellness, BRRSD became a Start With Hello district in 2019.This program teaches students in grades K – 12 to help their peers in a fun and meaningful way. They take small but powerful actions to promote inclusion and to support students who are showing signs of loneliness or social isolation.Loneliness is the overwhelming feeling of being left out and social isolation is not having frequent interactions with friends. Young people who feel this way may pull away from society, struggle with learning and social development, or choose to hurt themselves or others. Due to COVID-19, all students can empathize with the feelings of isolation due to physical and social distancing. Start With Hello is an important social and emotional learning program to reintroduce students to the power of connecting and helping one another.

Hillside’s 2020 - 2021 Clubs
Hillside’s Roots and Shoots Environmental Club is composed of Hillside’s Environmental Leaders and Protectors (HELP!) and Students Raising Students (SRS).  We meet together once a month on a Friday morning in Hillside’s Library.  Below is a description of each program component. 

HELP - HELP is the Roots and Shoots program dedicated to protecting animals and the environment.  Our mission is to create and maintain a native schoolyard habitat that attracts many different forms of wildlife.  We are responsible for organizing backyard workdays throughout the year and coordinating Hillside’s Forest Fest in June.  We are also involved with Martin Luther King Day of Service in January.  

STUDENTS RAISING STUDENTS (SRS) - is the Roots and Shoots program committed to learning about the lives of children around the world and to promoting the educational rights and aspirations of every child.  Specifically, our mission is to raise awareness about the impact of poverty on the lives of children in East Africa, and to increase their educational opportunities through scholarships.  We are responsible for sponsoring the Celebrity Chef Challenge in November and we have a booth at Hillside’s Forest Fest in June.  

Hillside Herald Newspaper Club – Club members serve as reporters, photographers, and illustrators for our school newspaper, the Hillside Herald. The Herald is published twice a year, affording many opportunities for club members to conduct interviews, write opinion pieces, news stories reporting on school activities, create puzzles and more.  Meetings are before school and are infrequent as much of the work is done independent of the meetings.

Hillside’s Student Council  - Elected students represent their homerooms and participate in a number of school-wide and community projects as well as hold fundraisers to benefit programs such as the Elle Foundation and the Ronald McDonald House.  Interest forms are distributed in homeroom by the 3rd week of September followed by elections.  Meetings are held once or twice a month on a Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. 
 

To register for clubs go to MyPaymentsPlus. Remember that some require a student be elected, audition and be cast, or be invited to participate.

                    <p class="p_modal">Absence and Attendance
Children are required by State law and Board of Education Policy to be in attendance at school every day that school is in session, except in cases of illness, death in the immediate family, or excused religious holidays. It is the responsibility of the students and their parents to assure that non-essential absences are avoided.

When a student is absent or expected to be absent from school the parent or guardian must report the absence by 9:00AM. See form link below. The parent/guardian may call but reporting online is preferred. Please include the student’s full name, grade, teacher, reason for absence and expected date of return.
When a child is absent for any reason, New Jersey State Law requires that written notice be provided to the school. Reporting an absence using the link below will fulfill this requirement. If the parent/guardian leaves the school a phone message they must follow up with a note to the student’s homeroom teacher on the day the student returns to school. If a note is not sent in then the absence will remain unexcused. A note verifies the absence, but does not necessarily excuse the absence.
The Attendance Officer, in accordance with State law and Board Policy, will investigate chronic absenteeism. Any student absent for three or more consecutive days because of illness must report to the nurse upon returning to school.
Students must be present in school a minimum of 2 hours to receive half-day credit and a minimum of 4 hours to receive full-day credit.
A student must be in school by 11:00am in order to participate in a contest/practice/activity that day. An exception will be made if the student has a medical or other approved appointment, in which case a signed statement by the physician or other authority must be submitted.
Absences Making Up Work
The student is responsible for all classwork, homework assignments and assessments missed because of absence. Teachers are available for assistance at a mutually agreeable time.

Student responsibilities include:

Asking the teacher(s) for the assignments that they have missed during their absences and arranging for extra help sessions/test make-up as needed.
Checking for missed assignments and homework by accessing the online Homework Portal.
Making up classwork, homework, and assessments due to school-related activities (i.e. music lessons, rehearsals, meetings, class trips)
FOR AN ABSENCE OF TWO DAYS OR LESS
Students and parents/guardians should access the online Homework Portal to check all assignments. Students are required to make up work due to an excused absence. It is the student’s responsibility to seek the work. If a student does not have the necessary materials to complete the work at home, he or she will be expected to finish the work upon returning to school.

FOR AN ABSENCE OF THREE DAYS OR MORE DUE TO ILLNESS
On the third day that a student is absent parents may request homework. This request must be made to the Guidance Office by 10am. The assignments will be ready for pick up by the end of the school day on the third day. Assignments can be sent home with another student.

Students have two days to make up missed work for every one day of absence, in consultation with their teacher.

REPORT AN ABSENCE

Academic Dishonesty
Cheating and plagiarism are dishonest acts that negatively impact teaching and learning. Any student giving or receiving answers on schoolwork without doing the work themselves will be considered guilty of cheating. Incidents of cheating, contributing to cheating, or engaging in plagiarism will be addressed by the teacher, guidance and/or administration.

After School Activities / Parent Pickup
The Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District encourages students to participate in after school and evening activities. The school cannot assume responsibility for care or supervision after the designated activity time. The following guidelines have been established to ensure that children are safe and cared for at the end of activities.

When appropriate, before the end of evening activities, students will be reminded of the ending time and the need to call home if necessary.
When parent/guardian is not present at the end of an activity, school staff will attempt to call 3 the parents after 15 minutes. If staff cannot contact a parent, the person in charge may call the police. Staff will remain with the child until the parent or police arrive.
If the parent/caregiver has been contacted and is en route, staff will remain with the child. If the parent does not arrive within 30 minutes the staff may notify the police.
Arrival at School
Students should arrive at their assigned bus stop prior to the scheduled pick up time.
Students being dropped off by parents or
walking to school should arrive at the school no earlier than 8:55 a.m. Adult supervision is not provided until 8:55 am unless the student is attending an approved before-school activity (rehearsal, extra help, etc.)
Walkers must use sidewalks and not walk through the school parking lot or neighboring yards.
Parents unloading students: Parents are requested to unload students in the designated areas only. Please drive carefully while exiting the parking lot and obey all posted signs to ensure student and staff safety.
Parents who have students who attend Before Care: please follow the program’s specific procedures for student drop-off.
Students attending extra help: Students attending extra help should not arrive any earlier than five minutes prior to the start of extra help. Students should not be in the hallways without their teacher being present - this includes accessing their lockers.
Students are to proceed directly to their classrooms when dismissed from their bus. All students must be seated in their classrooms when the bell rings at 9:05 a.m.
Please refer to the section on Tardiness for information about late arrival to school.

Bicycles
Students who ride bicycles must wear helmets and lock their bicycle with a lock in the bicycle racks provided. The school system is not responsible for bicycle theft or damage. Bicycles are not to be ridden on any part of the school property. No students are permitted to have motorized vehicles on school property, at any time, either when school is in or out of session.

Bus Conduct
The bus represents an integral part of the school system and, as such, the same standards of conduct that apply to a classroom apply to the school bus. For the safety of all riders, students are required to conduct themselves as indicated below:

Show respect for the driver, bus rules, and fellow passengers at all times.
Enter and leave the school bus in turn. No pushing or crowding.
Face forward and remain seated in the assigned seat while the bus is in motion. Seat belts, where provided, must be fastened.
Keep feet, hands, and belongings out of the center aisle.
No part of the body or any belongings may extend out of a window.
Talk in a reasonable tone of voice. No shouting. No profane or abusive language or behavior.
Keep the bus clean - no littering or defacing the bus. Students and their parents or guardians will be held financially responsible for any acts of vandalism.
No throwing of liquids or objects within or out of the bus.
No eating or smoking on the bus.
No physical contact with other students.
Students must ride to and from school on their assigned bus, and get on and off the bus at their designated bus stop. The transportation department must approve any change in bus assignments.

Bussing
Parent Responsibilities
Parents of children who are transported at public expense are asked to cooperate by seeing that the following rules are observed:

Ensure that their children arrive at the bus stop before the scheduled pick up time in the morning.
Safety is imperative - educate their children as to proper methods of going to or coming from the bus stop.
Accept joint responsibility with the school authorities for proper conduct of the children at all times.
In the event that there is a loss of bus privileges, parent/guardian must provide transportation to and from school for the student and cooperate with the school authorities in helping their child understand the seriousness of the action which resulted in loss of the bus privilege. If a parent does not provide transportation, the student will be considered truant for the time when the bus privilege is denied.
Students assigned to buses are not permitted to walk home from school unless an approved transportation waiver is on file at the school.
Questions or comments regarding transportation can be directed to the district Transportation Department at 908-722-1820, x12, x13 or x14.

Bus Passes
Students must only ride on their assigned bus to and from their assigned bus stop. Policy allows for transportation to a babysitter on a five-day a week basis. An emergency transportation pass for another bus or to another bus stop can only be issued in the event of death, sudden illness or other emergency in the family. All requests must be made in writing. If the request is approved a special bus pass will be issued by the principal/assistant principal.

Bus Violations
New Jersey State Law, Chapter 18A:25-2, states: "The driver shall be in full charge of the school bus at all times and shall be responsible for order; he/she shall never exclude a pupil from the bus, but if unable to manage any pupil, shall report the unmanageable pupil to the principal/assistant principal of the school he/she attends."
"A pupil may be excluded from the bus for disciplinary reasons by the principal/assistant principal and his/her parents shall provide for his/her transportation to and from school during the period of such exclusion."
The following consequences may be imposed for bus conduct violations:

First Offense - The student is reported to the school principal/assistant principal. A letter is sent to the student's parent/guardian, informing them of the problem, and indicating what procedures will be followed if a second or third offense occurs during the school year. Parents/Guardians will be provided a copy of the “Student Discipline/Code of Conduct” policy.
Second Offense - The student is reported to the school principal/assistant principal. The student is excluded from the bus for a period of five (5) school days and his/her parent/guardian shall provide transportation to and from school during that period. Absence from school during this period will be considered truancy. A letter will be sent to the student's parent/guardian informing them of the problem and the action taken, as well as what procedures will be followed if additional offenses occur during the school year.
Third Offense - The student is reported to the school principal/assistant principal. The student will be excluded from the bus for a period up to thirty (30) school days and his/her parent/guardian shall provide transportation to and from school during that period. Absence from school during this period is considered truancy. A letter will be sent to the student's parent/guardian informing them of the problem and the action taken, as well as what procedures will be followed if additional offenses occur during the school year.
Any Offense beyond the Third Offense in a school year - The student will be reported to the school principal/assistant principal.

The student’s parent or guardian shall provide transportation to and from school during that period. Absence from school during this period will be considered truancy. A letter will be sent to the student's parent/guardian informing them of the problem and the action taken, as well as what procedures will be followed if additional offenses occur during the school year.
Please Note: Bus suspensions may be carried from school year to school year.

Candy / Gum Chewing
Candy and gum chewing are not allowed during school hours and on the bus.

Cafeteria Procedures
The following procedures have been established to make the lunch period a relaxed but orderly time. All students are expected to follow these guidelines:

Students must remain seated in the cafeteria unless purchasing food or throwing trash away.
Food must remain in the cafeteria unless a student has the permission of a staff member to remove it.
Students are to place all trash/recyclables in the proper container.
All students at each table are responsible for leaving their tables and the surrounding area clean.
Students may leave the cafeteria to go to the lavatories by getting permission from the cafeteria assistants and signing the bathroom log sheet.
Students may be permitted to attend other activities at this time if they have been issued a pass by a teacher. The pass must be presented to a cafeteria assistant before the student leaves the cafeteria.
Students must wear suitable outer garments for outside recess. Please label outerwear and lunch bags with the student’s name.
Meal payment accounts are available for all students through the computerized cafeteria system – visit www.mypaymentsplus.com for details.
No electronic devices or cell phones may be used during lunch or recess.
Students must follow the rules and the directions of the Cafeteria Assistants. Proper Lunch Room behavior is expected at all times.
Cell Phones / Electronic Devices
Students are not permitted to use cell phones or electronic devices while school is in session. These items must be turned off and stored in students’ lockers while in the school building and throughout the school day. If a call home needs to be made during the school day, the phones in the classrooms should be used. The school assumes no liability or responsibility for these items.

Please note: Making phone calls, texting, gaming and taking pictures/videos are not permissible during the school day. Under no circumstance, inside or outside of school, should cell phones be used to photograph or film other students or used in a way that constitutes cyber-bullying behavior.

Character Education
The Intermediate Schools are dedicated to providing an educational center that optimizes learning opportunities in a cohesive and positive environment. Our faculty and staff are committed to the well-being of all members of the school community.

One of the ways we can facilitate this mission is through character education. Character can be referred to as “what we do when no one is looking.” A number of programs at the Intermediate Schools promote character education.

Class Trips
Class trips taken throughout the year play a role in the well-rounded education of students. To ensure the best experience for all students, guidelines will be set for any scheduled class trips. These include permission slips, dress requirements and responsible student citizenship. Students with a history of unacceptable behavior and/or suspension may lose their privilege to participate in class trips.

Computers / Use of Technology
The Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District believes that technology is a tool to provide students with 21st Century skills which will keep them competitive in the global workplace. It is not enough to simply add technology into existing teaching methods. Instead, technology must be strategically implemented to maximize the benefit to the students. The benefits of a technology infused classroom include the ability for teachers to deliver personalized learning to students, increase students’ 21st Century skills, and empower students in the learning process.

The use of district devices and networks must support and be consistent with educational objectives. Students are expected to follow the policies outlined by the district, including but not limited to the Acceptable Use Policy 2361, Electronic Communication and Recording Devices Policy 5516, and the Responsible Use Agreement. Inappropriate use as outlined in the District’s Policy 2361 may result in denial of the student’s use of the computers and computer networks. Violations of policy are unethical and may constitute a criminal offense.

At the beginning of each school year parents/guardians must sign the acknowledgement on the PowerSchool Emergency Form, agreeing that they accept responsibility for their child’s use of computers and computer networks in school and out of school.

Detention
Teachers and school administrators may assign detention. Detention may take place during lunch, recess, or before or after school. Students receive a minimum of one day's notice for a detention that will take place outside of school hours. It is the responsibility of the parents or guardians to provide transportation as it relates to before or after school detention.

Discipline
The professional staff of the school is expected to ensure student conduct conducive to an orderly educational program, to maintain an effective learning environment both in and outside the classroom and to help students achieve self- discipline necessary for the responsible use of freedom. (Refer to Board policy 5600).

The school staff reserves the right to take disciplinary action in the form of student conference, parental conference, lunch detention, before-school detention, after-school detention, restriction of privileges, in-school suspension, out- of-school suspension, or expulsion for the following disciplinary infractions, including, but not limited to:

insubordination
disrespect
physical altercations
disruptive behavior
obscene gestures
inappropriate language
leaving school grounds without permission
gambling
possession or distribution of items that are dangerous or distracting
any conduct of such nature as to constitute a danger to the well-being of others, or a disruption to the learning environment
A strong and ongoing partnership between home and school is crucial in addressing and correcting student misbehavior. Any student guilty of flagrant or repeated violations will be assigned more severe consequences.

Serious and/or repeated offenses may warrant a student being referred to the principal/assistant principal. 

Intermediate Student Discipline Chart

Distractions
Sometimes items that are brought or sent to school can be disruptive or pose a safety hazard to the educational environment. Therefore, students should bring to school only those materials needed for their academic studies.

The following are some examples of items that hinder instruction: jewelry, toys, electronic devices, games, locker decorations, skateboards, roller- sneakers, valuables, and large sums of money.

The sale or offering for sale of items or personal property by students is forbidden. Students should not bring items to school with the intent of bartering during lunch or anytime during the school day. This includes trading cards, electronic games, etc.

Dress and Grooming
Students are expected to dress appropriately, modestly and in good taste. Attire should not create a disturbance of the educational environment. Any type of clothing that does so will not be acceptable. The administration reserves the right to make the final decision regarding appropriate dress.

All clothing should be neat, clean and properly fitted.
Bare midriffs, spaghetti straps, halter tops and tube tops are not permitted. Straps of shirts must cover all undergarments completely.
Proper and safe footwear is required at all times. Students may not go barefoot. No slippers are to be worn.

Sunglasses may not be worn within the school building unless prescribed by a doctor.
Slogans or pictures which are obscene, sexually suggestive, or promote drugs or violence cannot appear on clothing, nor can patches and emblems be placed on clothing in areas which distract from good taste and do not reflect modesty.
Students not dressing appropriately for school may be asked to wear another shirt or a jacket, or to contact a parent/guardian to obtain suitable attire.

Early Dismissal/Parent Pickup
If a student is to leave school before the regular dismissal time, the following procedures must be followed:

The student must hand in a written note to the homeroom teacher, signed by the parent/guardian, with the first and last name of the student, indicating the time they are to be dismissed, the reason for the early dismissal, and who will be picking up the student, or submit form online below. 
In the event of an emergency appointment, please call the main office prior to your arrival so that we may notify your child and the appropriate teacher.
Students will only be dismissed to a parent/guardian, unless otherwise indicated in the note. Proper identification may be requested.
A student returning to school later the same day must be signed in and obtain a pass from the main office.
Please note that students must be present in school for four hours to receive full-day credit and two hours to receive half-day credit.

Extra Help
If a student is having difficulty in any subject, help outside the content of the regular school day is available. It is the student's responsibility to seek help. All teachers are available for help on specified days as posted in each classroom and on the Teacher Websites. If help is desired, the student and/or parent should make an appointment for extra help in order to confirm the time and place. The guidance counselors are available to assist in resolving difficulties with schoolwork as well as to coordinate extra help sessions.

Students should not arrive more than five minutes before the start of before-school extra help.

FERPA
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student records. Records are defined by FERPA. It also provides parents/legal guardians with the following rights:

To request and inspect their child’s records.
To request to amend the record if they believe it to be inaccurate.
To disallow any disclosure of directory information.
To file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education regarding district’s failure to comply with FERPA.
Fire / Security Drills
New Jersey School Law requires that each school hold fire drills regularly. Each classroom will have Fire Drill rules and directions posted. Students should be familiar with the exits from each room where they attend classes.

Regularly there are other drills related to various types of emergencies. Staff members will educate students on these drills. During these events, students are expected to remain silent and follow staff instructions.

During all drills, there is no talking and students are to leave the building quickly and without confusion.

Guidance
The guidance program provides our students with individual, group, and crisis counseling services. Students must get a pass from the classroom teacher or from the school counselor, and make arrangements for conferences, as needed. The school counselor may also be contacted to discuss academic and/or developmental concerns.

Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying
Introduction (see NJSA 18A:37, NJAC 6A:16, and Board Policy #5512): The Board prohibits acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying of a student on school property, at any school-sponsored function, on school buses, and, as appropriate, in other instances away from school grounds. Active or passive support for acts of harassment, intimidation, and bullying is also prohibited.

DEFINITION
(see N.J. Public Law 2010, chapter 122): Harassment, intimidation or bullying means any gesture, any written, verbal or physical act, or any electronic communication, whether it be a single incident or a series of incidents, that is reasonably perceived as being motivated either by an actual or perceived characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or a mental, physical or sensory disability or by any other distinguishing characteristics that takes place on school property, at any school-sponsored function, on a school bus or off school grounds that substantially disrupts or interferes with the orderly operation of the school or the rights of other students and that:

A reasonable person should know, under the circumstances will have the effect of physically or emotionally harming a student or damaging the student’s property, or placing a student in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm to his person or damage to his property;
Has the effect of insulting or demeaning any student or group of students in such a way as to cause disruption, in or interference with, the orderly operation of the school; or
Creates a hostile educational environment for the students; or
Infringes on the rights of the student at school by interfering with a student’s education or by severely or pervasively causing physical or emotional harm to the student.
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The district prohibits active or passive support for acts of harassment, intimidation or bullying. Students are encouraged to support other students who walk away from these acts when they see them, constructively attempt to stop them, and report acts to the building principal or designee. Each building principal will develop and provide a school-based program for appropriate recognition for positive reinforcement for good conduct, self- discipline, good citizenship, and academic success. The Board expects students to conduct themselves in keeping with their levels of development, maturity and demonstrated capabilities with proper regard for the rights and welfare of other students and school staff, the educational purpose underlying all school activities, and the care of school facilities and equipment. The Board believes that with the appropriate infusion of character education into the curriculum, modeling of appropriate behavior by adults and the support and assistance of parent/guardian, students, and the community, we will produce an environment that encourages students to grow in self-discipline.

Please see Board Policy 5512: Prohibiting Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying, for full text.

Homework
Homework is defined as an assignment to be prepared or completed at a time other than during regular class time and serves to reinforce instruction that has taken place or to prepare for an upcoming class topic.

Homework is an important part of the educational process. Repeated studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between effective study habits and completion of assignments and a student’s success in school. Homework, properly planned and purposeful in nature, should help students:

Learn to work independently and become self-reliant.
Organize and plan for their schoolwork.
Extend proficiency in effective habits and skills.
Increase knowledge and its application.
Develop insight and stimulate creativity.
Students must assume responsibility for homework assignments. Parents/guardians and teachers are partners in the education of students. Their joint effort in assessing and monitoring homework provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen the home-school partnership.

A teacher typically assigns homework 3-5 days per week. Developmental, achievement, and ability differences among student all impact the actual time that students may spend on assignments. Long term assignments will require additional time management skills.

Homework assignments can be accessed through the Homework Portal.

Health Office
It is the goal of the Health Office to provide services which will aid each student in achieving their optimum health potential, thereby enabling them to benefit from the educational program. Illnesses - If a student becomes ill at school, they will obtain a pass from their teacher and report to the Health Office. Parents will be notified if the student must go home. Students are not permitted to use their cell phones to contact their parent/guardian regarding pick up for illness.

Absence - If a student is absent, parents must notify the school by calling the school, or by reporting the absence online.

Accidents - All accidents, no matter how minor, are to be reported immediately to the supervising teacher. The supervising teacher will then notify the school nurse and follow her instructions. The nurse will administer first aid and notify parents if additional treatment is needed. If the nurse is not in her office, the student will report to the main office.

Medication – Whenever possible, students should be administered medication at home rather than at school. This includes both over-the-counter as well as prescription medication. If your child must take medication during the school day, district forms stating the name of the medication, dosage, time to be given, and other pertinent information must be filled out by the child’s physician and the parent/guardian and returned to the school nurse. The forms may be obtained from the Health Office.

Medication must be in the original container labeled by the pharmacy or physician. It will be kept in the school Health Office. Medication should not be kept by students to be self-administered except in special situations, documented by the child’s physician, where the student has asthma or a life- threatening condition. Arrangements must be made through the school nurse and the child’s physician. Medication must be dropped off and picked up by a parent or guardian.

Health Screenings
School health screenings are conducted on an annual basis per New Jersey state guidelines, unless a physical exam is completed by the student’s healthcare provider. Documentation of the physical exam must be submitted to the School Nurse. Parents will be notified if follow-up care is needed.

Screenings are performed by the School Nurse as follows:

Height, weight, blood pressure – all students are screened once per school year.
Vision and scoliosis – 6th grade students are routinely checked once per school year; 5th grade students may be checked upon parent request. A student may be excused from scoliosis screening upon written request to the School Nurse by a parent or guardian.
The nurse is available during school hours. Please feel free to contact the Health Office if you have any questions or concerns.

Hillside Health Office

Insurance
Parents/Guardians have an opportunity to purchase accident insurance for their student, for both the School Day and Around-the-Clock-Time. Information is available to parents/guardians online, with instructions on how to enroll.

The form to be completed in the event of an injury requiring medical attention is available online. It is the responsibility of each student to be sure that any accident occurring on school property is reported to the Health Office. It will be the responsibility of the parent to process all claims since the school is not the agent. Any questions about any claim must be directed to the insurance company and not the school.

Library
The Library is available all day for classes or individuals. Students may use the library during lunch as a quiet place to read or study, to complete classwork, or for STEAM projects. If an item is lost or not returned, a hold will be placed on the student's records until payment is made or the item is returned. Students may not have more than three items on loan at one time.

Lockers
Each student is assigned a locker at the beginning of the school year for his or her personal use. All lockers are the property of the Board of Education. The school reserves the right to inspect or search lockers at any time, and teachers do inspect lockers at various intervals throughout the year. Students should maintain an orderly locker and remove material that is not current. Pictures, slogans, or other items may not be posted outside lockers. No child may enter another student’s locker for any reason. There is a fee for lost/damaged locks/lockers.

The school assumes no responsibility in case of loss or theft.

Lost and Found
Students who have lost articles may go to the designated Lost and Found before school, during lunch, or after school to look for them. After a reasonable time, articles are donated to charity.

Parent Teacher Conferences
Parents may arrange conferences with teachers, counselors, or the principal/assistant principal at any time by calling the school.

Photography / Videography
Photographs and videos for such purposes as news media coverage of school activities, except for events open to the public, must be authorized in advance by the Superintendent in accordance with Policy 9400, News Media Relations and Policy 9120, Public Relations Program. Photographs and videos of pupils may be taken for news and media purposes. Parents/guardians may request in writing that their child(ren) not be included in any photograph or video taken for school district and/or outside publication.

Physical Education Excuses
All students participate in physical education and health instruction. It is necessary that all students be properly clothed for physical education class. Students are required to wear closed toe, low heeled, rubber-soled sneakers during P.E. Jewelry should not be worn.

Physical education excuses are issued by the school nurse in the case of temporary disability. P.E. excuses for more than three days require a doctor’s note. Students cannot resume P.E. activities after a serious illness, injury or surgical procedure without a medical release from his/her physician. A student who is injured during a physical education class must report the incident to both the P.E. teacher and the school nurse.

Promotion
Each student must demonstrate satisfactory academic performance to advance from one grade level to the next.

Progress Reports
Progress reports are issued through the online Parent Portal on a quarterly basis, midway through each marking period. These notices are posted to keep parents and students informed of academic progress and to suggest ways for removing deficiencies and improving grades.

Recess / Outside Play
Students have recess outside if weather permits and should dress appropriately for the weather. No food or drink is permitted at recess. Playground equipment must be returned to the Cafeteria Assistants at the conclusion of recess. Once outside, students are expected to follow the same rules established within the classroom and the school. Appropriate supervision is provided at all times and students must follow the rules and the directions of the Cafeteria Assistants

Report Cards
Progress in school is vitally important to students, parents and teachers. The report card is designed to help students and parents understand the student’s progress so that the school and home can work together in improving that progress. Report cards are accessible on the Power School Parent Portal on a quarterly basis. Students and parents/guardians are expected to review student progress via PowerSchool on a regular basis.

Incidents classified as vandalism will involve further school consequences and may involve the police. Any theft or damage to property may be cause for police notification.

School Sponsored Activites
Activities are held throughout the year to provide students with another opportunity for social development. Proper conduct is required at all times.

Smoking
By law no smoking, tobacco, or vaping products are permitted on school buses, school grounds, or in school buildings. Students are prohibited from possessing and/or carrying cigarettes or other tobacco or vaping materials on school grounds, in school buildings or on school buses.

Student Records
Parents, legal guardians, and adult students have a right to access pupil records. To learn about the procedure to inspect pupil records please refer to Policy 8330, Student Records or contact the school Principal. Health and Special Education records are maintained separately from the student academic record file.

Student Responsibilities
Students attend and participate in the school program so that they may develop to their fullest potential. With this in mind, students have the following responsibilities:

Accept responsibility for their actions.
Respect the rights of others, including the right to secure an education in an environment that is orderly and disciplined.
Attend school on a regular basis.
Be punctual.
Dress appropriately and maintain habits of personal hygiene.
Respect school property and help keep it free from damage.
Recognize that the school staff assumes the role of a surrogate parent in matters of behavior and discipline, from the time the student leaves home and until they return home, including school transportation and during any school- sponsored activities.
Make an earnest effort to do their best work.
Contribute toward establishing and maintaining an atmosphere that generates mutual respect and dignity for all.
Obey school rules and regulations.
Substance Abuse
District students are entitled to attend school free from the hazards and disruptive influence of drugs. The Board of Education defines drugs as alcohol and any controlled dangerous substance as identified by state law which includes, but is not limited to: marijuana, PCP, LSD, any chemical which releases fumes causing a condition of intoxication or dulling of the senses, and any behavior-altering chemical substances used or intended to be used for purposes other than the treatment of sickness or injury as prescribed by a physician.

Unauthorized use, possession, sale or distribution of drugs by students, or others in the school setting, which includes school buses and school functions,

will not be tolerated, nor will the presence in the school setting of anyone under the influence of drugs, including alcohol.

Students violating this policy will be referred for intervention. Following due process, such students may be subject to strict disciplinary procedures including suspension and/or expulsion. In addition, such students may be subject to court imposed penalties for violation of laws.
Any person engaging in the illegal use, possession or distribution of drugs in the school will be reported to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.
Inspections for the location of drugs are matters relating to health and safety, and may be regarded as reasonable purposes for searches by school personnel. (See section entitled LOCKERS).
More detailed information can be found in Board of Education Policy 5346 and Regulation 5346. In addition, the dangers of substance abuse, and effective decision- making skills for leading a drug-free life, are addressed in the health program and partnership programs such as S.H.A.R.E. and PRIDE.

Tardiness
Students are considered tardy for school if they are not in their assigned rooms at 9:05 a.m.
Procedure for Arrival after 9:05 a.m.:

Student and Parent/Guardian report to the Main Office.
The Parent/Guardian must sign in the student and indicate the reason for tardiness. Tardiness to school due to a medical appointment must be accompanied by a doctor’s note to be considered an excused absence.
The student will be given a pass in order to proceed to class.
A student is considered tardy to a particular class during the day if he/she is not in the designated classroom prior to the period bell.

If a teacher detains one or more students, who as a consequence arrive late to the next class, each student has the responsibility to request a pass from the teacher to bring to their next class thereby excusing the lateness.

Testing
The NJSLA (New Jersey Student Learning Assessments) computer-based assessments will be administered during the spring testing window.

District Testing Department

Textbooks
Textbooks are issued to all students. Books must have covers to protect them at all times. At the end of the school year, or upon transfer, all books checked out in a student’s name must be returned to the teachers. Payment must be made for lost or damaged books.

Transfers
When a student transfers out of the District a Parent/Guardian may have student records forwarded to a student's new school by completing the "Parent Authorization for Release of Pupil Records" form. This form can be obtained from the Guidance Office. A transfer card and all records will be forwarded to the new school when all books have been returned and all fines have been paid.

Visitors

Weapons / Dangerous Instruments
The Board of Education, Administration, and Professional Staff of the Bridgewater-Raritan School District stand united in their expression of intolerance for the presence of weapons in our schools. A weapon is defined as any instrument of offense or defense, which is capable of inflicting injury or death to someone.

In accordance with the Board of Education Policies 5611 and 8467, students who are found guilty of possessing a weapon in school, on school grounds, or on a school bus will be subject to expulsion from the school. To expel means to be removed from the school permanently. In addition, criminal charges will be filed with the Bridgewater or Raritan Police Departments.

Examples of items which would be considered weapons include, but are not limited to, the following:

Guns (loaded or unloaded): revolvers, BB guns, pellet guns, stun guns, air guns, dart guns, shotguns, rifles. *Also defined as any device or instrument in the nature of a weapon from which may be fired or ejected any solid projectable ball, slug, pellet, missile or bullet, or any gas, vapor or other noxious thing, by means of a cartridge or shell or by the action of an explosive or the lighting of flammable or explosive substances. This includes mace, pepper spray or like substance.

Knives: pocket knives, hunting knives, switch blades, gravity knives, daggers, stilettos, dirks.
